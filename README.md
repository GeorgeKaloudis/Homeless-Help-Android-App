# Homeless Help 
An Android App for helping homeless people during my thesis for my college.

The app allows users to locate homeless people in the city, to find necessary services and also to help through donations to charities e.t.c.
The basic functions of app are:
* Homeless Pins (Locate homeless people on the map)
* Add Marker (Create a new marker with information)
* Search (Search for nearby services around your area)
* Emergency Call
* Donation (Virtual)
